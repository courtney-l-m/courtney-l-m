# 👋 Hi, I’m Courtney

## 👾 About Me

I’m currently in my second year of studying web design and development. My knowledge includes HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and more!

Outside of web design and development, I enjoy watching movies, watching TV, playing video games, reading, and creating. Otherwise, I enjoy spending time with my dog Bella and cats Dio and Cipher. (Dio is the orange one, and Cipher is the tortoiseshell)
