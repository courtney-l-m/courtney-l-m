# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Courtney

## ðŸ‘¾ About Me

Iâ€™m currently in my second year of studying web design and development. My knowledge includes HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, UI/UX responsive design, Illustrator, Photoshop, and more!


Outside of web design and development, I enjoy watching movies, watching TV, playing video games, reading, and creating. Otherwise, I enjoy spending time with my dog Bella and cats Dio and Cipher. (Dio is the orange one, and Cipher is the tortoiseshell)
