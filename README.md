# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Courtney

## ðŸ‘¾ About Me

Iâ€™m currently in my second year of studying web design and development. So far I have learned interesting knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and more! All pretty cool so far.

I enjoy learningâ€¦ well most of the time at least. I plan on continuing my knowledge in animation or cybersecurity (eventually) for now my focus is solely on the web!

Outside of web design and development, I enjoy watching movies, watching TV, playing video games, reading, and creating. Otherwise, I enjoy spending time with my dog Bella and cats Dio and Cipher. (Dio is the orange one, and Cipher is the tortoiseshell)
